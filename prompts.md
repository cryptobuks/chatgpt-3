### As a Tech writer, I'm working on a Technical Design Document
I'm writing a TDD for a project, could you help to write some paragraphs for a gke overview? the goal is to let a beginner knows the concept, the advantage/benefit and why gke, may hight more advanced features that gke has comparing to any other similar products in the market?

looks great to me. could you introduce the components inside a GKE cluster and their features, functions, provide some links if the reader wants to refer for more details?

well those are all common things for both gke and open source kubernetes, could you revise to add more specific items GKE has? any references to GKE architecture and configuration?

### Act as a Linux Terminal
Contributed by: [Fatih Kadir AkÄ±n](https://github.com/f) Reference: https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/

I want you to act as a linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English, I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. My first command is pwd
```
pwd

-H "Authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY" \
-d '{
  "prompt": "Hello, my name is",
  "max_tokens": 5,
  "temperature": 0.5
}'
